TODO Figure out a good cadence for blocks: need to do division and decide upon a series of blocks to track for each

TODO grab loose, initial data to sanity check

TODO figure out best way to structure data for the four pools

--V1 query looks like:

  exchange(block: { number: 10610232 } id:"0x2a1530c4c41db0b0b2bb646cb5eb1a67b7158667"){
    combinedBalanceInEth
    combinedBalanceInUSD
		tokenName
    tokenBalance
    ethBalance
  }

--V2 query looks something like:

{
  pair(block: { number: 10610232 } id:"0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11") {
		reserveETH
    reserveUSD
    
  }
}


--Sushiswap query looks like:

{
  pair(block: { number: 12610432 }, id:"0xc3d03e4f041fd4cd388c549ee2a29a9e5075882f"){
    reserveETH
    reserveUSD
  }
}

--V3 looks like:

(this one is a bit funny because totalValueLockedUSD and totalValueLocked don't work well for the pool as a whole but does work for individual tokens)

pool(id:"0xc2e9f25be6257c210d7adf0d4cd6e3e881ba25f8"){
    token0{
      symbol
      totalValueLocked
      totalValueLockedUSD
    }
    token1{
      symbol
      totalValueLocked
      totalValueLockedUSD
    }
    
  }
